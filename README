In China, sometimes we can't access the global servers of Flickr.
I think you know the reason. ^_^

We are lucky, Flickr has other sets of server, such as East, West.
As I tested, East hosts are available always.
You can use "http://www.flickr.com/help/test" to test.
But we can't ask our PC/laptop to access these servers directly.

We have to cheat our machine by changing /etc/hosts (In windows: C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc).
In hosts file, we can create mapping between ip address and host name.
So we use the ip address of East servers and Global host names.

This script is used to generate such mapping text.

Requirement
==============
Make sure you have Python 2.7 in your OS.

Run
==============
Quite easy!
Just type: python flickr_serverip_getter.py
And after several seconds, you can get the mapping text, like:

          |	Global Host                   |	East Host                     |	East IP
